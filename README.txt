First attempt making a Discord bot. Uses Discord.js (which is Node), seems pretty intuitive.

Current Functionality:
  - Replies to certain keywords in messages
  - Reacts to messages depending on their content
  - Keeps a count of "good bot" (+1) or "bad bot" (-1), and can report the score whenever asked
  - Queries a free online D&D database to return spell descriptions nicely formatted
  - Rolls given dice + modifiers
  - Adds a role to users as soon as they join the Discord server
  - Repeats back whatever it is commanded to
  - Logs all messages sent from who & where & when in a text file
  - Stores previous variables in file to load from them again after restart
  - Holds a list of shopping items that can be manipulated in Discord
