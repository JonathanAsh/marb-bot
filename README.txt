First attempt making a Discord bot. Uses Node.js, haven't really used it before but it seems pretty intuitive. Currently hosted on a free VM on Microsoft Azure while I source a Pi to host it myself to make things a little easier.

Current Functionality:
  - Replies to certain keywords in messages with other keywords
  - Reacts to messages depending on their content
  - Keeps a count of "good bot" or "bad bot", and can report these scores whenever asked
  - Queries a free online D&D database to return spell descriptions nicely formatted
  - Rolls given dice + modifiers
  - Adds a role to users as soon as they join the Discord server
  - Repeats back whatever it is commanded to
  - Logs all messages sent from who & where & when in a text file

Commands I use in cmd to get it to run:
cd Desktop/Discord Bot
node bot.js
